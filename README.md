# Userland Frontier Kernel #

This is an unofficial fork of the Userland Frontier kernel. This is
mostly here for me to hack on occasionally and learn a little about
older software.

I am currently doing a major renovation on the `modern_carbon` branch.
My intention is to keep master stable, but up to date. As of 2014-01-04
the master branch will run on Mac OS X 10.10 (It will not *build* on 10.10.
~~It has to build against the 10.5 SDK because it relied on a LOT of 
deprecated frameworks.~~ It currently builds against the 10.6 SDK, but
still relies on deprecated frameworks.)

You can download a binary of the OPML Editor built from the master tree
here: [Download OPML Editor v10.1b21][1].
