# Userland Frontier Kernel #


As of 2014-01-04 the master branch will run on Mac OS X 10.11 (It will
not *build* on 10.10. It currently builds against the 10.6 SDK, but
still relies on deprecated frameworks.)

The `yosemite` branch builds and runs on OS X 10.11.

You can download a binary of the OPML Editor built from the master tree
here: [Download OPML Editor v10.1b21][1].
